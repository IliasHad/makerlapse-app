## About Me

I'm a self-taught developer and I love watching speed coding videos and see how things are built-in timelapse video effects and I was inspired by Devon Crawford Video which he makes a script to automate his video editing process and it's built it with C and FFmpeg after that I come up with idea for cross-platform desktop app using Node js and FFmpeg 

I built Makerlapse to document my journey as newbie indie maker and self-taught developer for my #12SideProjectsIn3Months Challenge

## Why I build Makerlapse?
When I started my indie making journey, I was working on my first app idea and I was reading a lot of articles about indie making from the IH interviews, posts, and also listening to the podcast. I read a post about building in public and the advantages from it and they're many ways to build in public (Live coding, share your daily todos and progress in Twitter)

I found an idea to document my journey while building an app and share it in a time-lapse video format

Also, I'm working on building a community to share your Makerlapse video with other like-minded people (for example junior developers who want to start #100daysofcode challenge and document their journey )

## What the current status of Makerlapse?
I was working on improving it the last couple of weeks but in the last two days, I was rebuilding it (from recording your screen in video format to just screenshots) and I think the app is ready for early adopters but the Mac OS Catalina isn't supported yet
